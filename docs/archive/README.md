# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical development documentation for Merits. These docs tracked the journey from initial concept to v0.1.0.

## What's Here

**Milestone tracking** (`milestone-*.md`):
- Development milestones 0-6
- Progress reports and completion summaries

**Phase planning** (`cli-phase-*.md`):
- CLI development phases 1-4
- Detailed implementation plans and checklists

**Roadmaps** (`roadmap*.md`):
- Original development roadmaps
- Feature planning and prioritization

**Design docs** (`*.plan.md`):
- Architecture planning documents
- Refactoring plans (e.g., tier refactor)

**Vision** (`vision.md`):
- Original vision document (client perspective)
- Now superseded by concise README.md

## Current Documentation

For v0.1.0 and beyond, see:

- **[../README.md](../../README.md)** - Getting started, API/CLI usage
- **[../architecture.md](../architecture.md)** - Codebase layout and design
- **[../auth.md](../auth.md)** - Challenge/response authentication
- **[../permissions.md](../permissions.md)** - Messaging permissions
- **[../future-work.md](../future-work.md)** - What's NOT included, roadmap

## Why Archived?

v0.1.0 is a clean starting point. The old docs are valuable history but add noise for new contributors. They're preserved here for reference but not actively maintained.

**Git tag**: `v0.1.0` captures the exact state when these docs were archived.

**Reason**: Simplify docs for v0.1.0 release
