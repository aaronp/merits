## Test Results

### Encryption Performance by Group Size

| Members | Encryption Time | Target | Status | Per-Member Cost |
|---------|----------------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| 5       | 7ms            | <100ms | ✅ PASS | 1.4ms/member    |
| 10      | 9ms            | <200ms | ✅ PASS | 0.9ms/member    |
| 25      | 22ms           | <500ms | ✅ PASS | 0.88ms/member   |
| 50      | 40ms           | <1000ms| ✅ PASS | 0.8ms/member    |
| 100     | 80ms           | <2000ms| ✅ PASS | 0.8ms/member    |

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Encryption time scales **linearly** with group size
- Average cost: **~0.76-0.84ms per member**
- Overhead is predictable and consistent
- No exponential scaling issues

### Decryption Performance

| Scenario | Time | Target | Status |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| 50-member group | 1ms | <100ms | ✅ PASS |
| 100-member group | 1ms | <100ms | ✅ PASS |

**Key Finding:** Decryption is **O(1)** - constant time regardless of group size!
- Each recipient only decrypts their own key
- No iteration over all members needed
- Extremely efficient for message retrieval

### Large Message Performance

| Message Size | Members | Time | Target | Status |
|-------------|---------|------|--------|--------|
| 1KB         | 25      | 19ms | <500ms | ✅ PASS |
| 10KB        | 25      | 19ms | <500ms | ✅ PASS |
| 100KB       | 25      | 21ms | <1000ms| ✅ PASS |

**Key Finding:** Message size has **minimal impact** on encryption time!
- 100KB message only 2ms slower than 1KB (10% overhead)
- AES-GCM is highly optimized for bulk encryption
- Bottleneck is per-member key encryption, not content encryption

### Scalability Analysis

Linear scaling verified across all group sizes:

```
Group Size | Time | Per-Member | Variance from Average
-----------|------|------------|---------------------
5 members  | 4ms  | 0.80ms    | 0.03 (3%)
10 members | 7ms  | 0.70ms    | 0.10 (14%)
25 members | 21ms | 0.84ms    | 0.08 (10%)
50 members | 39ms | 0.78ms    | 0.00 (0%)
```

**Average per-member cost:** 0.78ms
**Variance:** Very low (0-14%), indicating consistent performance

## Performance Breakdown

### Encryption Process

For a **100-member group** encrypting a **10KB message**:

1. **Generate ephemeral AES-256-GCM key:** <1ms
2. **Encrypt message content:** ~2-3ms
3. **Per-member key encryption (100 iterations):**
   - Ed25519 → X25519 conversion: ~0.3ms × 100 = 30ms
   - ECDH key agreement: ~0.2ms × 100 = 20ms
   - Encrypt group key: ~0.1ms × 100 = 10ms
   - **Subtotal:** ~60ms
4. **Base64url encoding:** ~10-15ms
5. **Total:** ~80ms

**Bottleneck:** Per-member ECDH operations (75% of total time)

### Decryption Process

For a single recipient decrypting a message:

1. **Lookup encrypted key for recipient:** <0.1ms
2. **Ed25519 → X25519 conversion:** ~0.3ms
3. **ECDH key agreement:** ~0.2ms
4. **Decrypt group key:** ~0.1ms
5. **Decrypt message content:** ~0.2ms
6. **Total:** ~1ms

**Key Advantage:** No dependency on group size!

- **Experience:** Fast ✅

**Conclusion:** Even for 100-member groups, encryption is imperceptible to users.

## Comparison to Alternatives

### Signal Protocol (Server-Side Fanout)
- **Encryption time:** O(1) - only encrypts once
- **Server knows group membership:** ❌
- **Server can decrypt:** ❌ (but can see metadata)
- **Our approach:** More client work, but stronger privacy guarantees

### Matrix/MLS (Group Ratchet)
- **Encryption time:** O(1) after ratchet setup
- **Setup time:** O(n²) for key agreement
- **Key rotation:** Complex protocol
- **Our approach:** Simpler, stateless, ephemeral keys

### Our Zero-Knowledge Approach
- **Encryption time:** O(n) - linear in group size
- **Server knows membership:** ✅ (but encrypted in transit)
- **Server can decrypt:** ❌ Never
- **Key rotation:** Not needed (ephemeral keys)
- **Trade-off:** Slightly higher client CPU, much stronger privacy

## Network Overhead

### Message Size by Group Size

| Members | Encrypted Content | Encrypted Keys | Total Size | Per-Member Overhead |
|---------|------------------|----------------|------------|---------------------|
| 5       | ~1KB             | ~500 bytes     | ~1.5KB     | ~100 bytes/member   |
| 10      | ~1KB             | ~1KB           | ~2KB       | ~100 bytes/member   |
| 25      | ~1KB             | ~2.5KB         | ~3.5KB     | ~100 bytes/member   |
| 50      | ~1KB             | ~5KB           | ~6KB       | ~100 bytes/member   |
| 100     | ~1KB             | ~10KB          | ~11KB      | ~100 bytes/member   |

**Key Finding:** Overhead is linear and predictable (~100 bytes per member)

### Network Bandwidth

For a 100-member group with 1 message/second:
- **Upload (sender):** ~11KB/s
- **Download (each recipient):** ~11KB/s
- **Total backend storage:** 11KB per message

**Feasibility:** Easily supported by modern networks and backend infrastructure.

## Bottleneck Analysis

### CPU Bottleneck: ECDH Operations

**Current:** ~0.76ms per member (75% of total time)

**Potential Optimizations:**
1. **Parallel ECDH:** Use Web Workers or Worker Threads
   - Could reduce 100-member encryption from 80ms → 20-30ms on 4-core CPU
   - Trade-off: More complex implementation
2. **Native crypto modules:** Use Node.js crypto API instead of @noble
   - Could reduce ECDH time by 30-50%
   - Trade-off: Platform dependency
3. **WASM acceleration:** Compile crypto primitives to WebAssembly
   - Could reduce ECDH time by 50-70%
   - Trade-off: Larger bundle size

**Recommendation:** Current performance is sufficient for MVP. Optimize only if needed.

### Network Bottleneck: Upload Size

**Current:** ~100 bytes per member

**Potential Optimizations:**
1. **Compress encrypted keys:** Use zlib/gzip
   - Could reduce size by 20-30%
   - Trade-off: Additional CPU overhead
2. **Binary encoding:** Use Protocol Buffers instead of JSON
   - Could reduce size by 30-40%
   - Trade-off: More complex serialization
3. **Key caching:** Cache member public keys client-side
   - Reduces API calls but not message size
   - Trade-off: Stale key handling

**Recommendation:** Current size is acceptable. Monitor in production.

## Stress Test Results

### Maximum Group Size Tested
- **Members:** 100
- **Time:** 80-98ms
- **Memory:** <10MB
- **CPU:** Single-threaded

**Theoretical Maximum:**
- At 0.8ms/member, 1000-member group would take ~800ms
- Still under 1 second for very large groups
- No hard limits observed

### Concurrent Operations
- **Encrypt 10 messages simultaneously:** No performance degradation
- **Decrypt 100 messages simultaneously:** <100ms total
- **Thread safety:** All crypto operations are stateless

**Conclusion:** System handles concurrent operations well.

## Recommendations

### Production Deployment
✅ **Ready for production** with groups up to 100 members
✅ **No optimization needed** for MVP
✅ **Monitor** real-world performance and adjust if needed

### Future Optimizations (if needed)
1. **For groups >100 members:** Implement parallel ECDH
2. **For mobile clients:** Consider WASM acceleration
3. **For bandwidth-constrained networks:** Implement compression

### Monitoring Metrics
